Machine-Learning Classification Project

This a project where I trained a model to recognize if a mushroom is edible or not.

I found this dataset on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification)

Model is the training of the model

App is the Flask application

Home is the HTML code for the application

I found help for this project via the Krish Naik content on his Youtube Channel and on his GitHub, Thanks to him.

I also found help for this project via the blog "Machine Learning Mastery" of Jason Brownlee, Thanks to him.
